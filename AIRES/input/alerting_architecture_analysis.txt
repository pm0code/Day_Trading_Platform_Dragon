AIRES Alerting Service Architecture Analysis Request
====================================================

CONTEXT:
We need to implement IAIRESAlertingService with proper architectural design validation.

CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION:
- Basic ConsoleAlertingService with 3 of 5 channels
- Missing: Windows Event Log, Health Endpoint
- No proper channel abstraction
- No throttling mechanism
- No alert persistence

REQUIREMENTS FROM DOCUMENTATION:
1. 5 Alert Channels: Console, Log Files, Alert Files, Windows Event Log, Health Endpoint
2. Alert Severity Levels: Critical, Warning, Info, Debug
3. Alert Throttling: 1 per minute same type, 10 per minute total
4. Alert Persistence with AlertRecord entity
5. Health Check functionality
6. Integration with AIRESServiceBase
7. Thread-safe for concurrent operations

GEMINI ARCHITECTURAL GUIDANCE:
- Use abstract factory and strategy pattern for channels
- Implement proper channel abstraction (IAlertChannel)
- Use dependency injection for all components
- Externalize configuration to appsettings.json
- Implement async operations for non-critical alerts
- Use proper locking mechanisms for thread safety
- Implement retry and circuit breaker patterns
- Use descriptive Windows Event Log entries
- Implement standardized health endpoint format

ANALYSIS NEEDED:
1. How to properly implement channel abstraction pattern
2. Best approach for alert throttling mechanism
3. Thread-safety implementation for concurrent alerts
4. Windows Event Log integration patterns
5. Health endpoint implementation approach
6. Alert persistence strategy
7. Configuration externalization approach
8. Integration with existing AIRES patterns

SPECIFIC QUESTIONS:
1. Should we use Channel Factory pattern or Strategy pattern for multi-channel support?
2. How to implement throttling without blocking critical alerts?
3. What's the best way to integrate with Windows Event Log in .NET 8?
4. Should health endpoint be part of alerting service or separate?
5. How to ensure thread-safety with minimal performance impact?
