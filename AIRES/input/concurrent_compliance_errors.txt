Build Error Report - ConcurrentAIResearchOrchestratorService Compliance Violations
================================================================================

/src/AIRES.Application/Services/ConcurrentAIResearchOrchestratorService.cs: error AIRES001: Not using AIRESResult<T> pattern - All operations MUST return AIRESResult<T> instead of Result<T>
/src/AIRES.Application/Services/ConcurrentAIResearchOrchestratorService.cs: error AIRES002: Missing IAIRESAlertingService integration - MANDATORY alerting service required in all components
/src/AIRES.Application/Services/ConcurrentAIResearchOrchestratorService.cs: error AIRES003: No test coverage - 0% coverage violates 80% minimum requirement
/src/AIRES.Application/Services/ConcurrentAIResearchOrchestratorService.cs: error AIRES004: Missing proper SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE error codes in error handling
/src/AIRES.Application/Services/ConcurrentAIResearchOrchestratorService.cs: error AIRES005: Developed without following booklet-first protocol - MANDATORY to use AIRES for its own development

Context: The ConcurrentAIResearchOrchestratorService was developed to improve performance through concurrent execution
while respecting data dependencies. However, it violates several MANDATORY standards from AIRES V5 requirements.

Key violations:
1. Using Result<T> from Foundation.Results instead of AIRESResult<T>
2. No alerting service injected or used in error handling
3. Zero test coverage (required: 80% minimum)
4. Generic error messages without proper error codes
5. Implementation created without first generating AIRES booklet
