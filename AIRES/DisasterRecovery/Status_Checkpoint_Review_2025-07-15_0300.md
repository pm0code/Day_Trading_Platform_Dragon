# Status Checkpoint Review (SCR)
**Date**: 2025-07-15 03:00 UTC
**Agent**: tradingagent
**Session**: Fixing AIRES test infrastructure StyleCop violations
**Fix Counter**: 10/10 - CHECKPOINT TRIGGERED

## üö® MANDATORY: SYSTEM ARCHITECT MINDSET

**CONFIRMATION**: I have read the PRD, EDD, and Architecture documents.

I am a SYSTEM ARCHITECT working on systematic resolution of StyleCop violations in the AIRES test infrastructure, following zero-mock policy and canonical patterns.

## üìä Session Overview

### Critical Discovery
- **Ollama was not responding** - User correctly stopped me from proceeding without AI validation
- **Root cause**: Was using wrong model name ("mistral" instead of "mistral:7b-instruct-q4_K_M")
- **Resolution**: Ollama is working correctly, consulted both Mistral and DeepSeek for guidance

### AI Consultation Results
1. **Mistral**: Provided general guidance on systematic approach
2. **DeepSeek**: Provided specific AIRES-focused guidance:
   - Move using directives outside namespace
   - Add parameter documentation for all public methods
   - Maintain blank lines between using groups
   - Order public members before private

### Work Completed
1. Fixed CS0103 error in TestCaptureLogger.cs
2. Added stylecop.json to TestInfrastructure project
3. Fixed InMemoryBookletPersistenceService.cs using directives
4. Fixed StoredBooklet.cs using directives
5. Created and ran fix-test-infrastructure.sh script
6. Fixed TestCaptureLogger.cs completely with all formatting
7. Fixed LogEntry.cs using directives
8. Fixed RecordedRequest.cs using directives
9. Fixed RequestMatcher.cs and ResponseConfiguration.cs
10. Fixed TestCompositionRoot.cs using directives

### Error Reduction
- **Starting**: 568 errors
- **After fixes**: 244 errors
- **Reduction**: 324 errors fixed (57% improvement)
