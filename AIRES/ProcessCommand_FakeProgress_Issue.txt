AIRES Development Violation Report
Date: 2025-07-15
Component: ProcessCommand.cs
Severity: CRITICAL

MANDATORY STANDARD VIOLATION: Zero Mock Implementation Policy

File: /mnt/d/Projects/CSharp/Day_Trading_Platform_Dragon/AIRES/src/AIRES.CLI/Commands/ProcessCommand.cs
Lines: 185-201

VIOLATION DESCRIPTION:
The ProcessCommand contains a fake progress simulation that violates the zero mock implementation policy. Instead of reporting real progress from the AI pipeline, it simulates progress based on elapsed time.

CODE CONTEXT:
```csharp
// Lines 185-201
while (!orchestratorTask.IsCompleted)
{
    var elapsed = DateTime.UtcNow - startTime;
    var stage = elapsed.TotalSeconds switch
    {
        < 10 => "Analyzing documentation",
        < 20 => "Examining context",
        < 30 => "Validating patterns",
        _ => "Synthesizing recommendations"
    };

    var progressPercentage = Math.Min((int)(elapsed.TotalSeconds / 40 * 100), 99);
    
    progress.Report(new ProcessingProgress
    {
        Stage = stage,
        PercentComplete = progressPercentage,
        Message = $"{stage}..."
    });

    await Task.Delay(1000, cancellationToken);
}
```

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- Real progress should be reported from AIResearchOrchestratorService
- Progress events should reflect actual AI model completion status
- No time-based simulations or fake delays

IMPACT:
- Users receive false feedback about pipeline progress
- Cannot track actual AI processing status
- Violates MANDATORY zero mock implementation policy
- Makes debugging and monitoring difficult

MANDATORY STANDARDS REFERENCE:
Section 1.2: Zero Mock Implementation Policy
- NEVER create mock implementations that pretend to work
- NEVER use hardcoded delays (Thread.Sleep) to simulate work
- ALWAYS provide real progress tracking and telemetry

Section 15: Progress Reporting
- Real progress tracking implementation required
- NO FAKE DELAYS allowed

RELATED COMPONENTS:
- AIResearchOrchestratorService
- IAIResearchOrchestrator interface
- ProcessingProgress class
- IProgress<T> interface
