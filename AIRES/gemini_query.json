      "text": "I need architectural guidance for fixing a critical violation in our AIRES (AI Error Resolution System) C# .NET 8 project. The ProcessCommand has a fake progress simulation that violates our zero mock implementation policy.\n\nCURRENT VIOLATION:\nThe ProcessCommand.ExecuteProcessAsync method contains time-based progress simulation instead of real progress from the AI pipeline:\n\n```csharp\n// Simulate progress based on expected timings\nvar stageIndex = 0;\n\nwhile (!orchestratorTask.IsCompleted && stageIndex < PipelineStages.Length)\n{\n    await Task.Delay(500); // Check every 500ms\n    \n    // Update progress based on elapsed time (rough estimation)\n    var elapsedSeconds = stopwatch.Elapsed.TotalSeconds;\n    \n    // Assume ~10 seconds per stage\n    if (elapsedSeconds > stageIndex * 10)\n    {\n        stageIndex = Math.Min(stageIndex + 1, PipelineStages.Length - 1);\n        ((IProgress<(string, double)>)progress).Report((PipelineStages[stageIndex], ProgressSteps[stageIndex]));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Must implement REAL progress reporting from AIResearchOrchestratorService\n2. Progress must reflect actual AI model completion status\n3. No time-based simulations or artificial delays\n4. Must follow IProgress<T> pattern correctly\n5. Must be thread-safe and support cancellation\n\nCONTEXT:\n- AIResearchOrchestratorService orchestrates 4 AI models sequentially\n- Each model (Mistral, DeepSeek, CodeGemma, Gemma2) processes errors\n- The orchestrator is injected via DI and implements IAIResearchOrchestrator\n- We use MediatR for command handling\n- All services extend AIRESServiceBase (not CanonicalServiceBase)\n\nQUESTION:\nWhat is the best architectural approach to implement real progress reporting from the orchestrator service to the CLI command? Please provide:\n1. Interface design for progress reporting\n2. Implementation strategy for the orchestrator\n3. How to wire progress updates through MediatR handlers\n4. Thread-safety considerations\n5. Code example showing the corrected implementation"
