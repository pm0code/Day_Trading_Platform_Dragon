# AIRES Development Journal - 2025-07-13 Session 2

**Agent**: tradingagent  
**Session Focus**: Foundation Implementation - Configuration System  
**Time**: Afternoon session

## Session Summary

Applied the MANDATORY execution protocol: THINK → ANALYZE → PLAN with AI validation → EXECUTE

### AI Validation Performed
1. **Ollama Consultation**: Queried about AIRES architectural priorities
2. **Gemini Consultation**: Received detailed phased approach recommendation

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Configuration System Implementation ✅
- Created comprehensive `aires.ini` configuration file with all settings
- Created `IAIRESConfiguration` interface with strongly-typed configuration sections
- Implemented `AIRESConfigurationService` extending AIRESServiceBase
- Registered configuration service in DI container
- Updated model names to match available Ollama models:
  - mistral-optimized:latest
  - deepseek-coder-optimized:latest
  - codegemma-optimized:latest
  - gemma2:9b

### 2. OllamaClient Updates ✅
- Discovered OllamaClient already properly extends AIRESServiceBase
- Already has LogMethodEntry/LogMethodExit in all methods
- Updated to use IAIRESConfiguration instead of IConfiguration
- Removed any hardcoded values (now uses configuration for base URL and retry settings)

### 3. Documentation Updates ✅
- Created MANDATORY_DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS-AIRES-V5.md (based on master V4 document)
- Deleted old V3 version to avoid confusion
- Updated all references to point to V5
- Updated PRD and EDD with correct dates (2025-07-13)
- Created comprehensive MasterTodoList_AIRES.md

## Technical Decisions

### AI-Validated Architecture Order
Based on Gemini's recommendation, implementing in this order:
1. **Configuration System** (DONE) - Removes all hardcoding at once
2. **AIRESServiceBase Verification** (DONE) - Already properly implemented
3. **OllamaClient Partial Fix** (DONE) - Now uses configuration
4. **Core Commands** (NEXT) - ProcessCommand, StartCommand, etc.

This approach minimizes rework and creates a solid foundation.

## Code Quality Metrics
- **Fix Counter**: [2/10]
- **Warnings**: Still 300+ (suppressed in GlobalSuppressions.cs)
- **Errors**: 0
- **Test Coverage**: 0% (CRITICAL VIOLATION)

## Next Steps
1. Fix ProcessCommand - Wire to real AIResearchOrchestratorService
2. Fix StartCommand - Implement real watchdog service
3. Fix StatusCommand - Connect to real status service
4. Fix ConfigCommand - Read/write aires.ini

## Challenges Resolved
- Initial date confusion (2025-01-13 vs 2025-07-13)
- Understanding that OllamaClient was already mostly compliant
- Choosing correct architectural order (validated by AI)

## Configuration Highlights
The new configuration system includes:
- Directory settings (input, output, temp, alerts, logs)
- AI service configuration (models, timeouts, retries)
- Pipeline settings (batch size, parallel processing)
- Watchdog configuration
- Processing limits and validation
- Alerting thresholds
- Logging configuration
- Performance settings
- Development flags

All hardcoded values have been moved to configuration, making the system flexible and testable.
