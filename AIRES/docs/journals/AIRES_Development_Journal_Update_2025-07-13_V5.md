# AIRES Development Journal Update - V5 Standards Creation

**Date**: 2025-07-13
**Agent**: tradingagent
**Task**: Create AIRES V5 Standards based on master V4 document

## Context
User discovered that I had created AIRES V3 standards based on an outdated document. The master standards document is V4 located at:
`/mnt/d/Projects/CSharp/Day_Trading_Platform_Dragon/AA.LessonsLearned/MUSTDOs/MANDATORY_DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS-V4.md`

## Actions Taken

### 1. Created MANDATORY_DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS-AIRES-V5.md
- Based on the master V4 document for trading platform
- Adapted specifically for AIRES as a standalone system
- Key additions:
  - Self-referential error resolution (AIRES must use itself)
  - Zero mock implementation policy
  - Comprehensive testing requirements (80% coverage)
  - Alerting and monitoring requirements
  - Observability and distributed tracing
  - Real progress tracking (no fake delays)

### 2. Removed Old V3 Document
- Deleted `/mnt/d/Projects/CSharp/Day_Trading_Platform_Dragon/docs/AIRES/MUSTDOs/MANDATORY_DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS-AIRES-V3.md`
- Avoids confusion between versions

### 3. Updated All References
- Updated EDD_AIRES_Engineering_Design_Document.md
- Updated PRD_AIRES_Product_Requirements_Document.md
- Updated AIRES_Development_Journal_2025-01-13.md

## Key Differences V3 â†’ V5

### Added in V5:
1. **Section 0.1**: Self-referential error resolution requirement
2. **Section 0.2**: Status Checkpoint Review (SCR) Protocol
3. **Section 0.3**: Gemini API integration for architectural validation
4. **Section 1.2**: Zero Mock Implementation Policy
5. **Section 16**: Observability & Distributed Tracing
6. **Section 17**: Alerting and Monitoring
7. **Section 18**: API Design Principles
8. **Section 19**: Comprehensive Testing (80% requirement)
9. **Section 20**: No Mock Implementations enforcement

### Enhanced in V5:
- More detailed enforcement mechanisms
- Automated enforcement via pre-commit hooks
- Comprehensive development checklist
- Quick reference card with correct patterns
- Clear violation consequences

## Impact
The V5 standards are now the authoritative guide for AIRES development, ensuring:
- Complete independence from trading platform
- No mock implementations allowed
- Comprehensive testing required (currently 0% - CRITICAL VIOLATION)
- Real functionality only
- Self-referential development (AIRES must process its own errors)

## Next Steps
1. Fix all mock implementations in CLI commands
2. Implement comprehensive logging/telemetry
3. Create test suite (80% coverage required)
4. Implement alerting system
5. Configure AI service endpoints properly
