| **Integration Testing** | Ensures modules interact correctly | - Test AI service pipeline integration<br>- Test configuration loading<br>- Test file system operations<br>- Test complete error processing flow |
| **System Testing** | Validates complete system against requirements | - End-to-end error file processing<br>- Watchdog mode operation<br>- CLI command execution<br>- Booklet generation and persistence |
| **Regression Testing** | Confirms changes haven't broken functionality | - **MANDATORY**: Run before every commit<br>- Automated test suite execution<br>- Build pipeline integration |
| **Performance Testing** | Assesses speed and resource usage | - Response time < 30s for typical error batch<br>- Memory usage < 500MB<br>- CPU usage monitoring<br>- Concurrent file processing |
| **Security Testing** | Identifies vulnerabilities | - Input validation for error files<br>- Secure AI service communication<br>- No sensitive data in logs<br>- Safe file system operations |

## ðŸ§ª Test Implementation Requirements

### Unit Tests
Location: `/tests/AIRES.*.Tests/`

Required test coverage:
- All public methods in services
- All command handlers
- All value objects
- All configuration providers
- All logging implementations

### Integration Tests
Location: `/tests/AIRES.Integration.Tests/`

Required scenarios:
- Complete error file processing pipeline
- Configuration loading and validation
- AI service communication
- File system operations
- Error handling flows

### System Tests
Location: `/tests/AIRES.System.Tests/`

Required scenarios:
- CLI command execution
- Watchdog mode operation
- Multiple file processing
- Error recovery
- Performance under load

## ðŸ”§ Testing Tools and Frameworks

### Required Testing Stack
- **xUnit**: Unit test framework âœ… (already in Directory.Build.props)
- **Moq**: Mocking framework âœ… (already in Directory.Build.props)
- **FluentAssertions**: Assertion library âœ… (already in Directory.Build.props)
- **Coverlet**: Code coverage âœ… (already in Directory.Build.props)
- **BenchmarkDotNet**: Performance testing (to be added)
- **WireMock**: HTTP mocking for Ollama (to be added)

### Test Execution
```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run with coverage
dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:CoverletOutputFormat=opencover

# Run specific test project
dotnet test tests/AIRES.Core.Tests

# Run with detailed output
dotnet test --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"
```

## ðŸ“Š Test Metrics Requirements

### Coverage Targets
- **Overall**: Minimum 80%
- **Core Domain**: Minimum 90%
- **Services**: Minimum 85%
- **Utilities**: Minimum 70%

### Performance Targets
- **Unit Tests**: < 100ms per test
- **Integration Tests**: < 1s per test
- **System Tests**: < 30s per test
- **Full Test Suite**: < 5 minutes

## ðŸš¨ Critical Testing Gaps (Current State)

Based on the comprehensive audit:
1. **ZERO test implementations** currently exist
2. **Mock CLI commands** need complete rewrite with tests
3. **No integration tests** for AI pipeline
4. **No system tests** for end-to-end flows
5. **No performance benchmarks** established

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priority**: Implement unit tests for existing services
2. **Secondary Priority**: Create integration tests for AI pipeline
3. **Tertiary Priority**: Build system tests for CLI commands
4. **Final Priority**: Performance and security testing
