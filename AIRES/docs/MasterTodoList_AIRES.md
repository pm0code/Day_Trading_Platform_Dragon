## 🚦 Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Mock implementations remain | High | Phase 0 priority, code review |
| Test coverage not achieved | High | TDD approach, coverage tools |
| Performance targets missed | Medium | Early profiling, optimization |
| Ollama compatibility | Medium | Version testing, fallbacks |
| Configuration complexity | Low | Clear documentation, defaults |

## 📝 Notes

- Follow MANDATORY_DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS-AIRES-V5.md for ALL work
- Use AIRES itself for error resolution (self-referential)
- No fixes without booklet generation
- Track fix counter and checkpoint every 10 fixes
- Maintain 0/0 policy (zero errors, zero warnings)
- All code must have real implementation (no mocks)
