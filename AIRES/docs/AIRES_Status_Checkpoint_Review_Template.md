# AIRES Status Checkpoint Review (SCR) Template
**Created**: 2025-01-13
**Purpose**: Comprehensive holistic review template for AIRES development checkpoints

## üö® MANDATORY: SYSTEM ARCHITECT MINDSET

**BEFORE EVERY CHECKPOINT - READ THIS ALOUD:**

> "I am a SYSTEM ARCHITECT working on AIRES, not a file fixer. I analyze the ENTIRE AIRES system for patterns, root causes, and systemic issues. I do NOT fix individual errors in isolation. I identify the architectural violations that created multiple errors and fix the SYSTEM, not the symptoms. Every fix must address root causes and prevent future violations. I think in terms of AI pipeline stages, service boundaries, canonical patterns, and system-wide impact. I am NOT a mechanic - I am an architect who designs solutions for the entire AIRES ecosystem."

**CRITICAL**: I MUST understand AIRES's foundational architecture:
- **Mission**: Autonomous error analysis through 4-stage AI pipeline (Mistral ‚Üí DeepSeek ‚Üí CodeGemma ‚Üí Gemma2)
- **Independence**: AIRES is a STANDALONE system with its own patterns
- **Self-Referential**: AIRES must analyze its own errors through its pipeline

**If you catch yourself fixing individual lines without understanding the systemic cause, STOP immediately and return to architectural analysis.**

## üìä MANDATORY: Fix Counter Protocol

**EVERY response during development MUST include:**
```
üìä Fix Counter: [X/10]
‚ö° Current Task: Brief description of what you're doing
üèóÔ∏è Build Status: Current error/warning count
‚úÖ Last Action: What was just completed
```

## Overview
This template must be used for EVERY 10 fixes during AIRES development. Create a timestamped copy in the /docs/checkpoints/ folder for each checkpoint.
