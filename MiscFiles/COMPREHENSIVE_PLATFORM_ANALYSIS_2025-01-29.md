## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the Day Trading Platform codebase, identifying components that need to be replaced, fixed, or kept. The analysis covers custom implementations, architectural patterns, incomplete features, and technical debt.

## 1. Custom Implementations Analysis

### 1.1 Logging Implementations

**Current State:**
