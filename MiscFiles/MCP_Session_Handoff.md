# MCP Code Analyzer - Session Handoff Document

## Current Status
- **Date**: 2025-01-26
- **Previous Work**: Day Trading Platform - paused at 56-60% completion
- **Current Task**: Building MCP Code Analyzer server

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Architecture
- Plugin-based extensible system
- Multi-protocol support (MCP, HTTP, WebSocket, gRPC, GraphQL)
- Multi-language support (C#, Python, Rust, PowerShell, Bash, etc.)
- Real-time analysis with incremental parsing
- Remote accessibility from any client

### 2. Comprehensive Analysis Coverage
- Architectural compliance (canonical patterns, modular design)
- Performance & scalability 
- Security scanning
- Code quality metrics
- Testing coverage
- Domain-specific rules

### 3. Project Setup
- Location: `/home/nader/my_projects/mcp-code-analyzer/`
- Language: TypeScript/Node.js
- Package name: `@mcp/code-analyzer`
- Initial structure created

## Design Documents
All design documents are in `/home/nader/my_projects/C#/DayTradingPlatform/MiscFiles/`:
- `MCP_CodeAnalysis_Design.md` - Initial design
- `MCP_CodeAnalysis_Project_Plan.md` - 8-week execution plan
- `MCP_CodeAnalysis_Extensible_Architecture.md` - Plugin architecture
- `MCP_CodeAnalysis_Comprehensive_Aspects.md` - Analysis categories
- `MCP_CodeAnalysis_Remote_Architecture.md` - Remote access design
- `MCP_CodeAnalysis_Language_Support.md` - Multi-language support

## Current Week 1 Tasks (from Project Plan)

### Day 1-2: Foundation
- [x] Create repository structure
- [x] Initialize TypeScript project
- [ ] Implement basic MCP server
- [ ] Set up testing framework
- [ ] Configure build system

### Week 1 Goals
- [ ] Basic MCP protocol implementation
- [ ] Tool registration system
- [ ] First analyzer (TypeScript)
- [ ] File watching capability
- [ ] Basic caching system

## Next Steps
1. Complete git repository setup
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Implement core MCP server functionality
4. Create base analyzer framework
5. Implement first language analyzer (TypeScript)

## Important Context
- This MCP server will be used to analyze the Day Trading Platform when we resume
- Focus on extensibility - we'll add more features over time
- Start simple, make it work, then enhance
- The server should be accessible from remote clients
- Real-time analysis is a key feature

## Commands to Start New Session
```bash
# In terminal
cd /home/nader/my_projects/mcp-code-analyzer
code .  # Open VS Code in the MCP directory

# Then start Claude

# Reference this document for context
```

## Day Trading Platform Resume Info
When MCP is complete, return to:
- `/home/nader/my_projects/C#/DayTradingPlatform/`
- Check `MainDocs/V1.x/Master_ToDo_List.md` for status
- Resume with Task 27.4 (Architecture analyzers)
- Use the new MCP server for real-time code analysis
