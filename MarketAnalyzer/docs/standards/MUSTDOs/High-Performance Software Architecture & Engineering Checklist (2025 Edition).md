* [ ] **Bounded contexts** well-defined and independent
* [ ] **Shared contracts/interfaces** extracted into reusable libraries
* [ ] **No duplicated services** if canonical ones exist, if not and valid case, they should be created and canonicalized**
* [ ] **Documented service dependency boundaries**
* [ ] **Contract-first API design** (OpenAPI, Protobuf, GraphQL)
* [ ] **Environment consistency via Dev Containers or Docker**
* [ ] **Tooling and SDK versions pinned and reproducible**

---

## üöÄ **II. Performance Optimization**

* [ ] **Efficient data access layer** (e.g., async, batching, pooling)
* [ ] **Concurrency model designed** (e.g., async/await, parallelism, task queues)
* [ ] **Benchmarking & profiling** enabled (e.g., BenchmarkDotNet, PerfView)
* [ ] **Memory & CPU usage monitoring** (especially under load)
* [ ] **Caching strategy** in place (in-memory, distributed, local)
* [ ] **Startup time optimization**

* [ ] **Background job queuing & rate limiting**
* [ ] **Edge/CDN usage where applicable**

---

## üîí **III. Security & Resilience**

* [ ] **Static security scanning** (e.g., Security Code Scan, SonarQube)
* [ ] **Dynamic runtime vulnerability scanning** (e.g., OWASP ZAP, DAST tools)
* [ ] **Secrets managed securely** (e.g., environment vaults, not in code)
* [ ] **Zero-trust model**: all service calls authenticated/authorized
* [ ] **Error handling standardized** (log + context + severity + user-safe output)
* [ ] **Dependency vulnerability scanning (SCA)**
* [ ] **JWT/session token validation rigorously tested**
* [ ] **Canonical logging with correlation IDs**
* [ ] **No silent failures** ‚Äî every exception must be logged
* [ ] **Rate limiting & circuit breakers implemented where needed**
* [ ] **Security headers set for web-facing components**
* [ ] **Formal verification for safety-critical components (if applicable)**

---

## üìä **IV. Observability & Telemetry**

* [ ] **Structured, centralized logging (JSON preferred)**
* [ ] **Entry/exit logging for all service methods**
* [ ] **Metrics collection integrated (e.g., OpenTelemetry, Prometheus)**
* [ ] **Tracing enabled for distributed systems**

* [ ] **.editorconfig & globalconfig.json defined**
* [ ] **Roslyn analyzers integrated** (custom + built-in)
* [ ] **StyleCop, SonarAnalyzer, Roslynator in use**
* [ ] **All warnings treated as errors in CI**
* [ ] **Pre-commit hooks: lint, format, analyze**
* [ ] **CI/CD pipeline with full code quality gates**
* [ ] **Dependency versioning pinned**
* [ ] **Logging, telemetry, and error handling enforced via analyzers**
* [ ] **Code metrics monitored (cyclomatic complexity, maintainability index)**
* [ ] **Documentation requirements enforced (README, API spec, diagrams)**

---

## üé® **VII. UI & Frontend Engineering**

* [ ] **Component-based architecture (React, Blazor, Angular, etc.)**
