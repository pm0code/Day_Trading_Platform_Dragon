## Session: 006 - Backtesting Engine Implementation Start

### Session Overview
Started implementation of the backtesting engine (Task 23) after completing the SARI algorithm.

### Completed Work

#### 1. SARI Algorithm Completion (Task 15) ✅
- **CorrelationAnalyzer.cs**: Dynamic and stressed correlation analysis
- **SARIPortfolioOptimizer.cs**: Stress-adjusted portfolio optimization with multiple algorithms
- **SARIRiskLimitManager.cs**: Dynamic risk limit adjustment based on SARI levels
- **SARIMonitoringService.cs**: Real-time monitoring and dashboard data service
- All 7 sub-tasks of SARI implementation completed successfully

#### 2. Multi-Screen Layout Research Integration
- Analyzed comprehensive research document on multi-screen trading platforms
- Updated Master Todo List with detailed UI/UX requirements
- Added Task 26 for hardware optimization and monitoring
- Updated target configuration to Professional (4 monitors) with expansion capability

#### 3. Target Hardware Configuration Update
- Changed primary target from Enterprise (6+ monitors) to Professional (4 monitors)
- Updated CLAUDE.md, README.md, and Master_ToDo_List.md
- Maintained scalability for future expansion to 6+ monitors
- Professional config: i7-13700K, 32GB RAM, RTX 4060, 4×27-32" displays

#### 4. Backtesting Engine Start (Task 23.1) ✅
- Created TradingPlatform.Backtesting project structure
- Designed comprehensive BacktestingArchitecture.md
- Created core interfaces:
  - IBacktestEngine (with optimization and walk-forward support)
  - IBacktestStrategy (strategy implementation contract)
  - IMarketSimulator (realistic market simulation)
- Defined domain models:
  - BacktestParameters (configuration)
  - BacktestResult (comprehensive metrics)
  - Supporting models (trades, equity curves, etc.)
- Created detailed README with usage examples

#### 5. Historical Data Management (Task 23.2) - In Progress
- Created IHistoricalDataProvider interface
- Implemented HistoricalDataManager with:
  - Efficient time series storage and retrieval
  - Corporate actions handling
  - Multi-symbol data alignment
  - Memory-efficient streaming
  - Intelligent caching with LRU eviction
  - Data quality validation

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Chose event-driven design for realistic market simulation
2. **Decimal Precision**: Maintained System.Decimal for all financial calculations
3. **Canonical Patterns**: All new components follow canonical service patterns
4. **Performance Focus**: Designed for parallel execution and GPU acceleration support
5. **Comprehensive Metrics**: Included all standard backtesting metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, etc.)

### Architecture Insights

The backtesting engine integrates with:
- **ML Models**: Can use XGBoost, LSTM, Random Forest in strategies
- **Risk Management**: Applies RAPM and SARI for position sizing
- **Data Providers**: Leverages existing AlphaVantage/Finnhub providers
- **TimescaleDB**: For efficient time series storage

### Performance Considerations

- Streaming architecture for large datasets
- Parallel backtesting support for optimization
- GPU acceleration hooks for intensive calculations
- Efficient caching to reduce data access overhead

### Next Steps

1. Complete historical data management implementation
2. Implement core backtesting engine
3. Create market simulation components
4. Build performance analytics
5. Add walk-forward analysis support

### Progress Summary

- Overall Platform Completion: 56-60%
- Completed Tasks: 11 (XGBoost), 12 (LSTM), 13 (Random Forest), 14 (RAPM), 15 (SARI)
- In Progress: Task 23 (Backtesting Engine)
- Remaining High Priority: Tasks 17, 18, 21, 23

### Technical Debt & Considerations

- Need to ensure backtesting results are reproducible (random seeds)
- Consider implementing distributed backtesting for large parameter sweeps
- May need to optimize memory usage for long backtesting periods
- Should add support for custom data sources beyond AlphaVantage/Finnhub
