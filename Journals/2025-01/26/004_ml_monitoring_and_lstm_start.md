**SequenceDataPreparation.cs**:
- Time series windowing with configurable length
- Multi-timeframe feature extraction (5, 15, 30 periods)
- Pattern metadata extraction (trend, volatility, support/resistance)
- Data augmentation (noise, time shift, scaling)
- Quality metrics for sequence validation
- Multiple normalization options (MinMax, Z-score, percentage)

**LSTMPatternModel.cs**:
- Bidirectional LSTM architecture with attention
- Multi-head attention mechanism (4 heads)
- Batch normalization and dropout (0.2)
- Architecture: Input â†’ BiLSTM(128) â†’ Attention â†’ BiLSTM(64) â†’ Dense(32) â†’ Output
- Support for TensorFlow and ONNX export
- Pattern analysis with interpretability

## Technical Highlights

### Performance Monitoring Innovation
```csharp
// Drift detection with sliding window
var driftScore = await driftDetector.CheckDriftAsync(input, prediction);
if (driftScore > DriftAlertThreshold) {
    await RaiseDriftAlert(modelId, driftScore);
}

// Health score calculation
var score = 100.0;
score -= 20 * (0.6 - accuracy);  // Penalty for low accuracy
score -= Math.Min(20, (latency - 100) / 10);  // Penalty for high latency
score -= Math.Min(20, driftScore * 100);  // Penalty for drift
```

### LSTM Architecture Design
```csharp
// Bidirectional LSTM with attention
keras.Sequential(new List<ILayer> {
    keras.layers.Bidirectional(keras.layers.LSTM(128, return_sequences: true)),
    keras.layers.BatchNormalization(),
    new MultiHeadAttentionLayer(4, 256),  // Custom attention
    keras.layers.Bidirectional(keras.layers.LSTM(64)),
    keras.layers.Dense(32, activation: "relu"),
    keras.layers.Dense(outputSize)
});
```

### Sequence Preparation Features
```csharp
// Multi-timeframe aggregation
var mtf = new MultiTimeframeFeatures {
    Timeframe5 = AggregateTimeframe(data, 5),
    Timeframe15 = AggregateTimeframe(data, 15),
    Timeframe30 = AggregateTimeframe(data, 30)
};

// Pattern complexity features
var entropy = CalculateApproximateEntropy(sequence);
var fractality = CalculateHurstExponent(sequence);
```
