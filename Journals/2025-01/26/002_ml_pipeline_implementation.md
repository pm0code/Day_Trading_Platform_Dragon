  - Data augmentation options
  - Dataset balancing for classification

### 4. XGBoost Model Implementation (Task 11.4) âœ…
- Implemented `XGBoostPriceModel` with:
  - Full training pipeline with progress reporting
  - Model evaluation with regression metrics
  - Single and batch prediction support
  - Feature importance extraction
  - Model persistence with metadata
  - Confidence score calculation
- Integrated with canonical ML service patterns

## Technical Highlights

### Feature Engineering Innovations
```csharp
// Advanced pattern complexity using approximate entropy
var complexity = CalculateApproximateEntropy(prices, m: 2, r: 0.2f);

// Fractality using Hurst exponent
var hurst = CalculateFractality(prices);

// Interaction features for stock ranking
output.PE_Momentum = input.PriceToEarnings * input.MomentumScore;
output.Beta_Returns = input.Beta * input.Return30Day;
```

### Model Training Configuration
```csharp
var trainer = _mlContext.Regression.Trainers.FastTree(
    numberOfTrees: 100,
    numberOfLeaves: 20,
    minimumExampleCountPerLeaf: 10,
    learningRate: 0.1
);
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Feature Extraction**: Optimized calculations using single-pass algorithms
2. **Data Loading**: Implemented parallel loading for multiple symbols
3. **Model Training**: Added caching for transformed datasets
4. **Inference**: Batch prediction support for efficiency

## Next Steps (Task 11.5+)

1. **Model Validation & Backtesting**:
   - Walk-forward analysis
   - Cross-validation framework
   - Performance metrics tracking

2. **Model Serving Infrastructure**:
   - Real-time prediction API
   - Model versioning system
   - A/B testing framework

3. **Real-time Inference Engine**:
   - Sub-50ms latency target
   - Feature caching
   - Model warm-up strategies

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Feature Engineering Complexity
- **Problem**: Managing 20+ features with interactions
- **Solution**: Created modular feature pipeline with caching

### Challenge 2: Time Series Data Handling
- **Problem**: Ensuring proper chronological splits
- **Solution**: Custom split logic preserving temporal order

### Challenge 3: Model Explainability
- **Problem**: XGBoost is somewhat black-box
- **Solution**: Implemented feature importance and placeholder for SHAP

## Code Quality

- Following canonical patterns throughout
- Comprehensive error handling with TradingResult<T>
- Async/await for all long-running operations
- Thread-safe model access with locks

## Time Spent

~4 hours on ML pipeline implementation
