   - Warning: Caution advised (Rules 4, 6, 9, 11, 12)
   - Info: Informational only

2. **Compliance Scoring**:
   - Each rule returns 0-1 compliance score
   - Overall assessment considers all rules
   - Blocking violations override everything

3. **Real-time Adaptation**:
   - Rules adapt to market conditions
   - Position context influences evaluations
   - Historical performance considered

### Integration Points

1. **Time Series Database**:
   - Stores all violations
   - Tracks compliance metrics
   - Session reports archived

2. **Message Queue**:
   - Real-time assessment events
   - Violation alerts
   - Compliance improvements

3. **Monitoring Service**:
   - Background compliance checks
   - Periodic reporting
   - Alert generation

### Architecture Benefits

1. **Modular Design**:
   - Each rule is independent
   - Easy to enable/disable rules
   - Simple to add new rules

2. **Canonical Pattern**:
   - Consistent with platform architecture
   - Full logging and metrics
   - Health monitoring built-in

3. **Comprehensive Coverage**:
   - Risk management (Rules 1, 3, 7, 8)
   - Strategy discipline (Rules 2, 5, 6)
   - Profit optimization (Rule 4)
   - Psychology (Rules 9, 10)
   - Market awareness (Rule 11)
   - Sustainability (Rule 12)

### Testing Approach

The Golden Rules engine provides:
- Unit testable rule evaluators
- Integration points for backtesting
- Real-time compliance monitoring
- Historical analysis capabilities

### Next Steps

1. Create comprehensive unit tests for all 12 rules
2. Implement backtesting framework
3. Add rule configuration UI
4. Create compliance dashboard
5. Performance optimization for real-time evaluation

### Observations

The 12 Golden Rules implementation provides a comprehensive framework for enforcing trading discipline. The modular design allows for easy customization while the canonical pattern ensures consistency with the rest of the platform. The real-time evaluation capability with sub-millisecond performance targets makes this suitable for high-frequency trading environments.
