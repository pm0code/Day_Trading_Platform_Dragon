# Disaster Recovery Initial Assessment
**Date**: 2025-01-09 08:30 AM
**Agent**: tradingagent
**Starting Errors**: 357 compilation errors
**Goal**: 0 errors/0 warnings

## Current State
- Project: MarketAnalyzer
- Build Status: FAILED - 357 errors
- Previous Agent Violations: 1,800+ individual standard violations across 265 service files

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Systematic Pattern Violations**:
   - 190+ services not extending CanonicalServiceBase
   - 210+ files missing LogMethodEntry/LogMethodExit
   - 50+ files using float/double for financial calculations
   - 488 duplicate type definitions

2. **Architectural Violations**:
   - Domain layer depending on Infrastructure
   - Application layer creating domain types
   - No single source of truth for types

3. **Process Violations**:
   - Checkpoints skipped
   - Build errors ignored
   - No holistic thinking applied

## Recovery Strategy
1. Understand canonical patterns first
2. Create global type inventory
3. Fix systematically with checkpoints every 10 fixes
4. Document every step for future reference

## Success Criteria
- 0 compilation errors
- 0 warnings
- All services extend CanonicalServiceBase
- All methods have proper logging
- All financial calculations use decimal
- Single source of truth for all types

**Next Step**: Build project to get exact error breakdown
