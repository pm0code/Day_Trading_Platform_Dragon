### Action Items for Next Batch
1. **Run build to verify error reduction**
2. Continue fixing remaining null reference errors
3. Search for float/double violations
4. Check LogMethodEntry/Exit coverage
5. Consider implementing retry policies with Polly
6. Start looking at duplicate type definitions beyond PositionSize/ExecutedTrade

2. **Type disambiguation continued** - ExecutedTrade aliases added
3. **Documentation enhanced** - SCR template now includes fix counter protocol
4. **Pattern recognition** - Identified cache retrieval null check pattern
5. **Holistic approach maintained** - No quick fixes, all changes considered globally
