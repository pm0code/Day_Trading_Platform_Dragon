## Key Finding: PositionSize Type Analysis

### Current State:
1. **Canonical Type Exists**: `MarketAnalyzer.Foundation.Trading.PositionSize` (CORRECT)
2. **Domain Type Removed**: Comment in BacktestingTypes.cs line 390 confirms removal
3. **But Services Still Reference**: Domain.PortfolioManagement.ValueObjects.PositionSize

### Root Cause:
The Application layer services are still trying to use the removed Domain type instead of the canonical Foundation type.

### Error Pattern Analysis:
- **CS1729**: 'PositionSize' does not contain a constructor that takes 0 arguments
  - Canonical PositionSize is immutable with builder pattern
  - Services trying to use object initializer syntax
  
- **CS0200**: Properties cannot be assigned to -- they are read only
  - Canonical type has readonly properties
  - Services trying to mutate properties directly

- **CS0117**: 'PositionSize' does not contain definitions for SizingMethod, ExpectedRisk, ExpectedReturn
  - These properties don't exist in canonical type
  - Services expect different type structure

### Services Affected:
1. PositionSizingService.cs - Multiple locations trying to create PositionSize incorrectly
2. BacktestingEngineService.cs - Type conversion errors between List types
3. Multiple services expecting mutable PositionSize

## Next Steps:
1. Check canonical PositionSize structure to understand correct usage
2. Update all services to use Foundation.Trading.PositionSize
3. Use builder pattern for creating instances
4. Remove any remaining Domain references
