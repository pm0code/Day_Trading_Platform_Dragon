# First Build Check After Initial Fixes
**Date**: 2025-01-09 09:45 AM
**Agent**: tradingagent
**Fix Count**: 3/10

## Fixes Applied So Far
1. Analyzed type duplication issue - Domain PositionSize was removed
2. Documented type resolution strategy
3. Fixed unqualified List<PositionSize> to List<Foundation.Trading.PositionSize> in PositionSizingService.cs line 693

## Key Findings
- Domain layer's PositionSize was removed (confirmed in BacktestingTypes.cs)
- Application services still import Domain.PortfolioManagement.ValueObjects
- This creates phantom type resolution issues
- Most code already uses Foundation.Trading.PositionSize correctly
- Only found one unqualified reference that needed fixing

## Next Steps
1. Run build to see error reduction
2. Systematically check each error for similar patterns
3. Consider removing unnecessary Domain.ValueObjects imports
4. Focus on type conversion errors between lists

## Hypothesis
The single fix might resolve multiple cascading errors if it was preventing proper type resolution.
