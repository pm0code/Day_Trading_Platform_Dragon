# Build Error Investigation

## Investigation Results

### Error Pattern Mismatch
The build error claims:
- Line 138: `CS1729: 'PositionSize' does not contain a constructor that takes 0 arguments`

But inspection shows line 138 correctly uses Builder pattern:
```csharp
var positionSize = new PositionSize.Builder()
```

### Hypothesis
The error line numbers appear to be incorrect or there's a compilation state issue.

### Action Plan
1. Need to run a full clean build to get accurate error locations
2. Possible that errors are cascading from missing SizingMethod enum
3. May need to check if there are partial compilation states

## Next Steps
1. Check if SizingMethod enum exists
2. Do a clean build to get fresh error locations
3. Systematically fix from Foundation layer up

**Status**: Need clean build for accurate error locations
