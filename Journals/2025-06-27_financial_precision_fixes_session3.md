# Financial Precision Fixes - Session 3

**Date**: 2025-06-27
**Focus**: Continuing systematic float/double → decimal conversion
**Status**: IN PROGRESS

## Summary

Continued fixing financial precision violations. Made progress on smaller files while identifying complex files that need more careful attention.

## Files Fixed in This Session

### 1. ModelServingInfrastructure.cs
- **Occurrences Fixed**: 7 double → decimal (100% complete)
- **Key Changes**:
  - Success rate calculations
  - Traffic split parameters
  - Latency and performance metrics
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - 0 float/double remaining

### 2. ModelValidationTests.cs
- **Occurrences Fixed**: 7 float → decimal (100% complete)
- **Key Changes**:
  - Mock model bias and confidence parameters
  - Price change calculations
  - Test metrics dictionaries
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - 0 float/double remaining

### 3. ModelDashboard.cs
- **Occurrences Fixed**: 8 double → decimal (100% complete)
- **Key Changes**:
  - Health score calculations
  - Chart data arrays
  - Resource utilization metrics (CPU, Memory, GPU, Network)
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - 0 float/double remaining

## Progress Update

- **ML Files Fixed**: 18/141 (13% complete)
- **Files with float/double remaining**: 28 (down from 34)
- **Complex files identified**:
  - CorrelationAnalyzer.cs (183 occurrences - uses MathNet.Numerics)
  - Requires careful handling due to external library dependencies

## MCP Server Connection

- **Issue Identified**: Not properly connected to MCP server
- **Resolution**: MCP server is running externally
- **Documentation Reviewed**:
  - USER_GUIDE.md - Comprehensive usage instructions
  - AGENT_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md - Subscription model for tools
- **Next Step**: Use MCP tools as documented for continuous analysis

## Key Observations

1. **Systematic Progress**: Targeting files with fewer occurrences first is effective
2. **Interface Changes**: Modifying interfaces (like IMLModel) will require updating all implementations
3. **External Libraries**: Files using MathNet.Numerics need special consideration
4. **Test Files**: Even test files must use decimal for financial precision consistency

## Technical Debt

The continued discovery of float/double violations reinforces that the Day 1 mandate from FinancialCalculationStandards.md was not followed during initial development. Each fix reduces crash risk and improves financial calculation accuracy.

## Next Steps

1. Continue with files having < 30 occurrences
2. Create strategy for MathNet.Numerics dependent files
3. Ensure MCP analyzer runs continuously during fixes
4. Update all interface implementations after interface changes
5. Run comprehensive tests after each batch of fixes
