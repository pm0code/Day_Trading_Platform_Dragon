# Trading Agent Learning Journal - July 14, 2025 (Health Checks Update)

## Session Summary
**Agent**: tradingagent  
**Date**: July 14, 2025  
**Session Duration**: ~30 minutes  
**Context**: Registering BookletPersistenceHealthCheck in CLI  
**Status**: Build successful, runtime issue with command resolution

## Work Completed

### 1. Added BookletPersistenceHealthCheck Class
Successfully created `BookletPersistenceHealthCheck` in `ServiceHealthChecks.cs`:
- Implements `IHealthCheck` interface
- Delegates to `BookletPersistenceService.CheckHealthAsync()`
- Provides fallback for basic availability check

### 2. Registered Health Check in CLI
Added registration in `AIRESCommandLineInterface.cs`:
```csharp
services.AddSingleton<Health.IHealthCheck>(sp => 
    new Health.BookletPersistenceHealthCheck(
        sp.GetRequiredService<Application.Interfaces.IBookletPersistenceService>()));
```

### 3. Fixed Build Issues
- Fixed CS1998 by changing `async Task<>` to `Task<>` and using `Task.FromResult`
- Fixed SA1108 by moving inline comment to its own line
- Added missing using directive for `AIRES.Application.Services`

### Build Status
- **Final Build**: SUCCESS - 0 errors, 0 warnings
- All projects built successfully after clean rebuild

## Current Issue

**Runtime Error**: "Could not resolve type 'AIRES.CLI.Commands.HealthCheckCommand'"

This appears to be a dependency injection issue where the Spectre.Console CLI framework cannot resolve the command types. The same error occurs for all commands (status, health, etc.).

### Possible Causes:
1. Service lifetime mismatch (Scoped vs Singleton)
2. Missing service registrations
3. Spectre.Console DI integration issue
4. Order of service registration

### Investigation Done:
- Verified all commands are registered in `AIRESCommandLineInterface.cs`
- Confirmed all health checks are registered
- Clean rebuild completed successfully
- Help command works, showing all commands are recognized

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate DI Resolution**: Check if there's a missing service that HealthCheckCommand depends on
2. **Review Service Lifetimes**: Ensure all dependencies have compatible lifetimes
3. **Test Individual Components**: Create unit tests for health check components
4. **Debug DI Container**: Add logging to understand what's failing during resolution

## Key Learnings

1. **Build Success â‰  Runtime Success**: The code compiles correctly but has runtime DI issues
2. **Spectre.Console DI**: The CLI framework has specific requirements for command resolution
3. **Health Check Integration**: All health checks are properly implemented and registered

## Technical Debt

None added - the implementation follows all established patterns. The runtime issue needs to be resolved before the feature is complete.

## Session Metrics

- **Files Modified**: 4
- **Build Errors Fixed**: 3
- **Lines Added**: ~50
- **Status**: Build complete, runtime resolution pending
