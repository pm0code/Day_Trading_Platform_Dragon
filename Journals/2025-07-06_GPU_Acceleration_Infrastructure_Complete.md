### 3. Automatic GPU Detection and Prioritization

#### GPU Selection Algorithm
The system implements intelligent GPU selection with scoring:

```csharp
private int CalculateDeviceScore(Device device)
{
    int score = 0;
    
    // Device type scoring
    score += device.AcceleratorType switch
    {
        AcceleratorType.Cuda => 1000,   // Prefer NVIDIA
        AcceleratorType.OpenCL => 500,  // AMD/Intel second
        AcceleratorType.CPU => 100,     // CPU last resort
        _ => 0
    };

    // Memory scoring (1 point per GB)
    score += (int)(device.MemorySize / (1024L * 1024L * 1024L));

    // RTX detection bonus
    if (device.Name.Contains("RTX"))
    {
        score += 500;
        if (name.Contains("RTX 40")) score += 200;      // Latest gen
        else if (name.Contains("RTX 30")) score += 150; // Previous gen
        else if (name.Contains("RTX 20")) score += 100; // Older gen
    }
    
    return score;
}
```

- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks GPU utilization and performance metrics

### 4. Decimal Precision Strategy

#### Challenge Addressed
GPUs don't natively support decimal types used in financial calculations. Implemented solution:

#### Scaled Integer Arithmetic
- All decimal values scaled by 10,000 (4 decimal places precision)
- GPU processes using 64-bit integers
- Results converted back to decimals on CPU
- Maintains precision required for financial operations

```csharp
// Example: $123.45 -> 1,234,500 (scaled) -> GPU processing -> $123.45
decimal price = 123.45m;
long scaledPrice = (long)(price * 10000);
// GPU kernel processes scaledPrice
decimal result = gpuResult / 10000m;
```

### 5. Performance Capabilities

#### Expected Performance Gains
- **Technical Indicators**: 10-100x speedup vs CPU for large datasets
- **Stock Screening**: 50-200x speedup for parallel criteria evaluation
- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: 100-1000x speedup for parallel paths
- **Risk Calculations**: 20-100x speedup for portfolio analysis

#### GPU Utilization Strategy
- **Small datasets (< 1000 securities)**: Use CPU to avoid GPU overhead
- **Medium datasets (1000-10000)**: Single GPU acceleration
- **Large datasets (> 10000)**: Multi-GPU distribution
- **Real-time operations**: Persistent GPU context to minimize initialization

### 6. Integration Architecture

#### Automatic Task Assignment
The system automatically determines optimal compute resource:

```csharp
protected override async Task<ScreeningResult> ProcessAsync(ScreeningRequest request)
{
    if (_gpu.IsGpuAvailable && request.Stocks.Length > 1000)
    {
        // Automatically use GPU for large datasets
        return await _gpu.ScreenStocksAsync(request.Stocks, request.Criteria);
    }
    
    // Fall back to CPU for small datasets or if GPU unavailable
    return await base.ProcessAsync(request);
}
```
