# Day Trading Platform - ITradingLogger Interface Rename
## Date: June 23, 2025

### Overview
Completed major refactoring to rename ILogger interface to ITradingLogger throughout the entire codebase to avoid confusion with Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger.

### Problem Identified
- Using the name `ILogger` for our custom logging interface created confusion with Microsoft's ILogger
- This made the codebase harder to understand and maintain
- Could lead to accidental usage of wrong interface

### Solution Implemented

1. **Interface Rename**
   - Renamed `ILogger` to `ITradingLogger` in `/TradingPlatform.Core/Interfaces/`
   - Added comment explaining the rename to avoid future confusion

2. **Global Search and Replace**
   - Created script `rename_ilogger_to_itradinglogger.sh` to systematically rename all references
   - Updated 68 files across the entire solution
   - Updated TradingLogOrchestrator to implement ITradingLogger

3. **Files Updated** (68 total)
   - All services using logging updated to use ITradingLogger
   - TradingLogOrchestrator now implements ITradingLogger
   - All dependency injection updated

### Key Learning
**CRITICAL**: Never use generic names like `ILogger` that conflict with common framework interfaces. Always use domain-specific names like `ITradingLogger` to make the codebase clearer and avoid confusion.

### Results
- ‚úÖ Successfully renamed ILogger to ITradingLogger globally
- ‚úÖ Fixed MethodInstrumentationInterceptor.cs (8 errors resolved)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 79 new errors discovered related to LogInformation method calls
- üîÑ Need to fix remaining interface method mismatches

### Next Steps
1. Fix LogInformation method calls (not in ITradingLogger interface)
2. Address remaining 79 compilation errors
3. Ensure all logging goes through TradingLogOrchestrator

### Technical Notes
- Windows line endings issue encountered but resolved with dos2unix
- Script location: `/scripts/rename_ilogger_to_itradinglogger.sh`
- All work done on RYZEN, ready for testing on DRAGON
