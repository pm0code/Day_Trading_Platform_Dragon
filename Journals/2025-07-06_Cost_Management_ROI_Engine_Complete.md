## Interactive Dashboard Features

### Action Button Logic
**Smart Recommendations Based On**:
- **ROI Performance**: >30% = upgrade, 15-30% = keep, 0-15% = optimize, <0% = stop
- **Utilization Rate**: >80% = upgrade, 50-80% = keep, 30-50% = optimize, <30% = downgrade
- **Budget Status**: Over budget = suspend/stop, approaching limit = optimize
- **Signal Quality**: High accuracy = keep/upgrade, low accuracy = optimize/stop
- **Cost Trends**: Increasing costs = optimize, stable costs = monitor

### User Experience Design
**Intuitive Controls**:
- Color-coded buttons (green=keep, red=stop, yellow=suspend)
