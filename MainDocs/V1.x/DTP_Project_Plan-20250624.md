## MVP-First Development Strategy

The platform is developed using a **two-phase approach**:

- **Phase 1 (MVP):** Use exclusively free tools and services for rapid, cost-effective development and validation.
- **Phase 2 (Premium Upgrade):** Enhance proven components with paid solutions for improved performance, scalability, and enterprise features.

**MVP Strategy Benefits:**

- **Rapid Development:** Faster time-to-market using established free platforms.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Zero licensing costs during validation phase.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Validate core functionality before premium investments.
- **Learning Curve:** Master fundamentals before advanced feature integration.

**MVP Free Tool Foundation:**


| Component | MVP (Free) | Future Premium Upgrade |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Development IDE | Visual Studio Community 2022 | Visual Studio Enterprise |
| Market Data | Alpha Vantage, Finnhub (free) | Bloomberg, Trade Ideas |
| Database | SQL Server Express, InfluxDB OSS | SQL Server Enterprise, InfluxDB Cloud |
| Charting | TradingView Basic Widgets | TradingView Pro/Premium |
| News Feed | Benzinga Free, NewsAPI | Reuters, Bloomberg News |
| Cloud Hosting | Azure Free, AWS Free | Azure/AWS Premium |
| Messaging | RabbitMQ Community | RabbitMQ Enterprise |
| Monitoring | Application Insights Free | Premium APM Solutions |
| Testing | MSTest, Moq | Advanced Testing Suites |
| Version Control | GitHub Free | GitHub Enterprise |

**MVP Feature Limitations & Workarounds:**

- **Alpha Vantage:** 500 calls/day – focus on top 50-100 most active stocks.
- **Finnhub:** 60 calls/minute – implement intelligent queuing.
- **NewsAPI:** 1,000 requests/day – cache news for multiple symbol queries.
- **Prioritize symbols by user watchlist, volume/volatility, and recent news activity.**

## Special Notes

- **PowerShell Practices:** Always place `param()` first, dynamic version detection, strict error handling.
- **Naming Conventions:**
    - Projects: PascalCase with provider suffix (e.g., FinnhubTestHarness)
    - Tests: `[Provider][Mode]Tests` (e.g., `FinnhubMockClientTests`)
    - Scripts: `run-integration-tests-v{version}.ps1`
- **Logging:** ISO timestamps, structured levels, JSON API archives.
- **Versioning:** Tag `v1.0-integration-ready`, `v1.1-mock-complete`, `v2.0-alpha-vantage`, etc.


## Deployment Target

- **OS:** Windows 11 x64 only (MVP), with future multi-platform support.
- **Toolchain:** Visual Studio 2022 (core), VS Code (test harness), PowerShell 7.5.1.
- **Versioning:** Tag as `v1.0-beta` once all Beta Deliverables are complete and tested.


## Summary

This holistic project plan provides a clear, up-to-date, and comprehensive orientation for all team members and AI systems. It merges the strategic vision, technical foundation, and operational roadmap from both planning documents, eliminating redundancy and improving clarity. The plan emphasizes a phased, MVP-first approach using free tools for rapid validation, followed by a smooth upgrade path to premium solutions as the platform matures.
