## 1. Core Architectural Components and Interactions

### 1.1 Multi-Source Data Integration Framework

Modern high-performance trading systems require sophisticated data ingestion capabilities that process heterogeneous data streams in real-time. The architecture consists of three primary data layers:

**Market Data Layer**: Processes 25+ features including Level II order book data, VWAP calculations, and Bollinger Band deviations at 100ms intervals. The system implements volatility-normalization techniques that scale features relative to 30-day historical volatility to maintain stationarity during market shocks.

**News Sentiment Engine**: Leverages fine-tuned RoBERTa models with financial domain-specific tokenization to analyze 850+ news sources and SEC filings. The architecture incorporates temporal attention gates that weight sentiment impact based on proximity to earnings announcements, with proprietary "sentiment decay" models reducing news influence after 2 trading hours.

**Alternative Data Integration**: Processes satellite imagery, supply chain logistics data, and social media momentum scores through graph neural networks. Cross-modal alignment layers map unstructured data to market time intervals using temporal graph convolutions.

### 1.2 Real-Time Processing Infrastructure

The system employs a distributed computing infrastructure with multiple nodes across geographical locations to ensure fault tolerance and minimize latency. Key components include:

Financial institutions implementing edge computing report 69% reduction in transaction processing times.

**FPGA-Accelerated Processing**: Hardware acceleration enables 8ns feature preprocessing latency, critical for high-frequency trading scenarios where microseconds determine profit margins. The system employs specialized hardware for cryptographic operations to minimize security overhead impact on performance.

**Kubernetes-Managed Microservices**: Container orchestration provides automated scaling, service discovery, and health monitoring, with successful implementations reducing infrastructure costs from $20,000 to under $7,000 monthly while maintaining 99.99% uptime.

### 1.3 AI/ML Prediction Engine Architecture
