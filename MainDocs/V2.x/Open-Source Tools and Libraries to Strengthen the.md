## 2. Gap Analysis

The existing PRD/EDD outlines a high-performance day trading platform with RAPM (Risk-Adjusted Profit Maximization) and SARI (Stress-Adjusted Risk Index) capabilities, but several gaps can be addressed with the recommended tools. **Apache Arrow** addresses the data serialization bottleneck identified in ACT-PERF-001 by providing a zero-copy columnar format that can reduce latency in the critical path [1][3]. The current EDD specifies a 50ms latency budget, which Arrow can help achieve through efficient memory layout and SIMD optimization [4]. **Polars** fills the gap in ACT-DATA-001 by providing a more efficient DataFrame implementation than the currently unspecified data processing library, with 5-10x performance improvements and lower memory requirements [5][6]. For the real-time market data ingestion (ACT-ARCH-001), **Apache Pulsar** and **Kafka** provide more robust solutions than the generic "Apache Kafka" mentioned in the EDD, with Pulsar offering better performance at high throughputs [9][12]. The AI integration capabilities (ACT-AI-001) lack specific protocols for tool integration, which **Model Context Protocol** directly addresses by providing a standardized way for AI models to interact with trading tools and data [15][17]. The EDD's extensibility framework (ACT-EXT-001) would benefit from **Axum**'s performance characteristics for API development [22][23]. Finally, the risk management system (ACT-RISK-001) could leverage **TimescaleDB**'s relational capabilities for complex risk calculations and historical analysis [7][8].
