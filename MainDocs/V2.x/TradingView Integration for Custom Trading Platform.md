**TradingView vs Traditional Platforms:**
Legacy platforms like MetaTrader 5 and NinjaTrader offer robust trading capabilities but struggle with modern web deployment and user experience expectations[^34][^35].

## SECTION 8: Technical Integration Guide

### Web Application Integration

**React Integration Example:**

```javascript
import { createChart } from 'charting_library';

const TradingViewChart = ({ symbol, interval }) => {
    useEffect(() => {
        const widget = new TradingView.widget({
            container: 'tv_chart_container',
            library_path: '/charting_library/',
            datafeed: new YourCustomDatafeed(),
            symbol: symbol,
            interval: interval,
            theme: 'dark',
            toolbar_bg: '#f1f3f6',
            autosize: true
        });
        
        return () => widget.remove();
    }, [symbol, interval]);
    
    return <div id="tv_chart_container" style={{ height: '600px' }} />;
};
```

**Angular Integration:**
Angular integration follows similar patterns using the widget constructor within component lifecycle hooks, ensuring proper cleanup on component destruction[^9].

### Desktop Application Integration

**Electron Implementation:**

```javascript
const { BrowserWindow } = require('electron');

function createTradingWindow() {
    const win = new BrowserWindow({
        width: 1200,
        height: 800,
        webPreferences: {
            nodeIntegration: false,
            contextIsolation: true
        }
    });
    
    win.loadFile('trading-view.html');
}
```

**WebView2 Integration:**
For .NET applications, WebView2 provides seamless TradingView integration within desktop applications while maintaining web-based functionality[^9].

### Data Feed Implementation

**UDF Protocol Setup:**

```javascript
// Custom datafeed implementation
class CustomDatafeed {
    onReady(callback) {
        setTimeout(() => callback({
            exchanges: [{
                value: 'YOUR_EXCHANGE',
                name: 'Your Exchange',
                desc: 'Your Exchange Description'
            }],
            supported_resolutions: ['1', '5', '15', '30', '60', 'D', 'W', 'M']
        }), 0);
    }
    
    searchSymbols(userInput, exchange, symbolType, onResultReadyCallback) {
        // Implement symbol search logic
    }
    
    resolveSymbol(symbolName, onSymbolResolvedCallback, onResolveErrorCallback) {
        // Return symbol information
    }
    
    getBars(symbolInfo, resolution, from, to, onHistoryCallback, onErrorCallback, firstDataRequest) {
        // Fetch historical data
    }
}
```


### Real-time Data Integration

**WebSocket Implementation:**

```javascript
class RealtimeDataProvider {
    constructor(datafeed) {
        this.datafeed = datafeed;
        this.subscribers = new Map();
        this.socket = new WebSocket('wss://your-data-provider.com');
        
        this.socket.onmessage = (event) => {
            const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
            this.updateSubscribers(data);
        };
    }
    
    subscribeBars(symbolInfo, resolution, onRealtimeCallback, subscribeUID) {
        this.subscribers.set(subscribeUID, {
            symbolInfo,
            resolution,
            callback: onRealtimeCallback
        });
    }
    
    unsubscribeBars(subscribeUID) {
        this.subscribers.delete(subscribeUID);
    }
}
```
