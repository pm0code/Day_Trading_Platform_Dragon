# Status Checkpoint Review (SCR) Template
**Created**: 2025-01-09
**Purpose**: Comprehensive holistic review template for MarketAnalyzer development checkpoints

## 🚨 MANDATORY: SYSTEM ARCHITECT MINDSET

**BEFORE EVERY CHECKPOINT - READ THIS ALOUD:**

> "I am a SYSTEM ARCHITECT, not a file fixer. I analyze the ENTIRE system for patterns, root causes, and systemic issues. I do NOT fix individual errors in isolation. I identify the architectural violations that created hundreds of errors and fix the SYSTEM, not the symptoms. Every fix must address root causes and prevent future violations. I think in terms of layers, dependencies, patterns, and system-wide impact. I am NOT a mechanic - I am an architect who designs solutions for the entire system."

**CRITICAL**: I MUST read the product's foundational documents to understand the ENTIRE system holistically:
- **PRD**: `/MainDocs/After_Pivot/PRD_High-Performance Day Trading Analysis & Recommendation System.md`
- **EDD**: `/MainDocs/After_Pivot/EDD_MarketAnalyzer_Engineering_Design_Document_2025-07-07.md`
- **Master Todo List**: `/MainDocs/After_Pivot/MasterTodoList_MarketAnalyzer_2025-07-07.md`

These documents provide the complete vision of why MarketAnalyzer exists, how all components interconnect, and what the ultimate desired results are. Without understanding the product's purpose and architecture, I cannot make systemic decisions that serve the overall goals.

**If you catch yourself fixing individual lines without understanding the systemic cause, STOP immediately and return to architectural analysis.**

## 📊 MANDATORY: Fix Counter Protocol

**EVERY response during development MUST include:**
```
📊 Fix Counter: [X/10]
⚡ Current Task: Brief description of what you're doing
🏗️ Build Status: Current error/warning count
✅ Last Action: What was just completed
```

## Overview
This template must be used for EVERY 10 fixes during development. Create a timestamped copy in the DisasterRecovery folder for each checkpoint.
