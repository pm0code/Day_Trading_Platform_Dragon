## Prompt to tradingagent: Full Architecture Review for Financial Day Trading Product on Windows 11 x64 (High-Performance Platform)

You are tasked with performing a **comprehensive software architecture analysis** of a **financial day trading product** that is designed to run on a **Windows 11 x64 workstation** with the following key platform traits:

* Intel Core i9-14900K (24-core, overclocking enabled)
* 32 GB --> soon to be upgraded to 64 GB DDR5 memory @ 6400MT/s
* UEFI Boot and PCIe 4.0/5.0 support
* GPU0: NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti (Ada Lovelace)
* GPU1: NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti (Ampere)
* Storage: M.2 NVMe PCIe 4.0

The **goal** is to assess and report on the software’s **cohesiveness**, **correctness**, **performance**, **resilience**, **security posture**, and **alignment with modern development pillars**, while identifying **any architectural flaws, bugs, or improvement opportunities**.

### ✅ Evaluate the Following Core Areas:

#### 1. 📐 *Architecture Correctness & Modularity*

* What architecture pattern is used (monolith, microservices, hexagonal, layered, etc.)?
* Are concerns cleanly separated (UI, domain logic, infrastructure)?
* Are modules cohesive and loosely coupled?
* Is the system properly layered with defined API boundaries?

#### 2. 🛡️ *Security & Platform Integrity (Windows-specific)*

* Does the software:
  * Support HVCI/VBS protections without incompatibility?
  * Harden against Windows-specific vulnerabilities (DLL injection, COM hijacking, UAC bypass)?

#### 3. 🧠 *Modern Software Engineering Pillars (include these throughout the review)*

* **Reliability** – Is it robust under stress, spikes, and partial failures?
* **Security** – Are best practices used (OWASP, threat modeling)?
* **Maintainability** – Is the codebase testable, modular, and well-documented?
* **Observability** – Are there structured logs, traces, metrics, dashboards?
* **Scalability** – Can the system scale with data or user growth?
* **Performance** – Is it optimized for high-throughput, low-latency execution?
* **Resilience** – Does it recover gracefully from service or network failure?

#### 4. ⚙️ *Hardware Optimization (Specific to DRAGON platform)*

* Is the software:

  * Multi-threaded or parallelized to leverage 24-core i9 CPU?
  * Optimized to minimize latency spikes (important for trading)?
  * Capable of leveraging AVX/AVX2/SSE instruction sets?
  * Using GPU acceleration (TensorRT/CUDA) where applicable (e.g., ML inference)?
  * Memory-efficient for DDR5 @ 6400MT/s and large capacity?

#### 5. 📈 *Real-time Data Integrity and Trading Logic*

* Are trade signals, market data, and order books handled reliably and with low-latency?
* Is there deduplication, data validation, and timestamp integrity?
* Are message queues (e.g., Kafka, NATS) used reliably, if present?

#### 6. 🧪 *Testing and Quality Assurance*

* Are all layers tested: unit, integration, system, regression, performance?
* Is the testing environment aligned with the production (Win11 x64)?
* Are mocks, fakes, or test doubles used appropriately?

#### 7. 🌐 *Network, Connectivity & Failure Modes*

* How does the software behave with:

  * Market data feed loss or corruption?
  * Internet or broker API outages?
  * Connection jitter and packet loss?
* Is exponential backoff, retries, circuit breaking used?

#### 8. 🚀 *Deployment, Upgrades & CI/CD*

* Is there a secure deployment mechanism (MSI, winget, etc.)?
* Are upgrades atomic and rollback-capable?
* Is there telemetry/metrics on installations and updates?

#### 9. 🔎 *Bug Patterns & Anti-Patterns*

* Look for:

  * Concurrency issues (race conditions, deadlocks)
  * Memory leaks or excessive GC
  * UI thread blocking on async ops
  * Repeated access of local disk/registry slowing execution

#### 10. 📊 *Compliance & Financial Domain Rules*

* Does it comply with applicable standards like:

  * PCI-DSS (if handling payment)
  * SEC/FINRA data retention or audit trail rules
  * GDPR/CCPA (if user data involved)?
