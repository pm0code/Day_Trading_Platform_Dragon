## generate a comprehensive project plan for the AI system to consume and use as the global orientation document for the project.

✅ Requirements:
Purpose:
Create a self-contained, complete and comprehensive and up-to-date, and readable project plan that acts as the source of truth for any AI system or new developer to get fully up to speed.

Top Section – Reference Documents:
List all essential reference documents (file names + short description) required for full project understanding (e.g., TestHarnesses.filestructure.md, GoldenRules.md, Architect with holistic view.md, etc.). I have uploaded the file 'mainfilelist.md' that has all the file names for your reference.

Content Scope – Be Holistic and Exhaustive:

✅ Project Name and Objective
✅ Major Components (e.g., DayTradingPlatform, TestHarnesses, etc. , ...)
✅ Architectural Principles (e.g., Golden Rules, Architect with holistic view.mdlogging, test layering, ...)
✅ Current File Structure Overview. 'DayTradingPlatform.filestructure.md' is uloaded for your reference.
✅ Development Tools/Environments Used (VS 2022, VS Code, PowerShell, etc.)
✅ Known Issues / Gaps / Production Blockers
✅ Completed Milestones (integration test suite for Finnhub, GitHub repo setup)
✅ In-Progress Tasks (mock test validation, CI/CD planning)
✅ Next Steps and Roadmap (short-term + long-term)
✅ Future plans, enhancements, additions, improvements
✅ Special Notes (PowerShell practices, naming conventions, etc.)

A concise overview appears below, followed by detailed sections covering reference materials, architecture, status, and roadmap.

## Reference Documents

- **mainfilelist.md** – Master list of all project documents and file names.

- **Day-Trading-Stock-Recommendation-Platform-PRD.md** – Product requirements document.
- **Testing-Strategy-v1.md** – Testing layers, frameworks, and best practices.
- **Architect with holistic view.md** – System-wide review protocol and holistic analysis guidelines.


## Project Name and Objective

DayTradingPlatform – A modular, extensible, and robust stock recommendation engine that screens, monitors, and alerts on day-trading opportunities using multiple data sources.

## Major Components

- **TradingPlatform.Core** – Business models, interfaces, financial math utilities.
- **TradingPlatform.DataIngestion** – Finnhub \& AlphaVantage provider implementations, HTTP clients, configuration.
- **TradingPlatform.Screening** – Screening engine, criteria evaluators, alert services.
- **TradingPlatform.Utilities** – Helper libraries, logging, validation.
- **TestHarnesses** – FinnhubTestHarness \& AlphaVantageTestHarness with Mock and Live integration suites.
- **Automation Scripts** – `run-integration-tests-v6.ps1` for mock/live test orchestration.


## Architectural Principles

- **Golden Rules** – Complete files, clear headers, diff before updates, snapshotting, PowerShell+CLI standards.
- **Holistic Review** – Trace data/control flow, validate configuration \& DI, enforce non-regression.
- **High Performance** – Non-blocking async, parallel processing, caching patterns.
- **Modularity \& Extensibility** – Clear separation, DI, plugin-style provider adapters.
- **Observability** – Structured logging, metrics, tracing, API response archiving.
- **Test Layering** – Unit/mock tests, integration/live tests, pipeline tests, end-to-end scenarios.


## Current File Structure Overview

Refer to **DayTradingPlatform.filestructure.md** for a full tree. Key highlights:

- `TradingPlatform.Core/` – Interfaces \& models.
- `TradingPlatform.DataIngestion/Providers/` – `FinnhubProvider.cs`, `AlphaVantageProvider.cs`.
- `FinnhubTestHarness/` – Integration \& mock test projects under `src/…Tests/`.
- `scripts/` – PowerShell automation scripts.
- `logs/` \& `TestResults/` – Directory placeholders with `.gitkeep`.


## Development Tools \& Environments

- **IDE:** Visual Studio 2022 (primary), VS Code (test harness, scripts).
- **Scripting:** PowerShell 7.5.1
- **Runtime:** .NET 8.0 SDK
- **CI/CD (planned):** GitHub Actions
- **Package Management:** NuGet, MockHttp (RichardSzalay.MockHttp), Moq (when needed)


## Known Issues / Gaps / Production Blockers

- **Resilience Testing:** No network-failure/time-out simulation tests.
- **Performance Tests:** Absence of SLA enforcement tests (<500ms).
- **Data Pipeline Tests:** Missing end-to-end API→model→consumer validation.
- **CI/CD Workflows:** GitHub Actions scaffolding exists but not yet enabled.
- **Documentation:** Some sections of PRD and Testing Strategy need merging into central docs.


## Completed Milestones

- **Integration Tests (Finnhub):** 7 live API tests passing, real data validated.
- **Mock Tests (Finnhub):** 5 unit tests with full mock coverage, offline execution confirmed.
- **Automation Script:** `run-integration-tests-v6.ps1` with dynamic versioning, logging, error handling.
- **GitHub Repo:** Initial commit with full source, README, .gitignore, folder placeholders.


## In-Progress Tasks

- **AlphaVantage Harness:** Scaffolding in progress, client \& tests to be implemented.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Workflow files authored; awaiting secrets \& activation.
- **Data Pipeline Tests:** Drafts for schema \& quality tests pending.


## Next Steps \& Roadmap

**Short-Term (1–2 weeks):**

- Finalize **AlphaVantageTestHarness** (Unit \& Integration).
- Implement **Resilience Tests** (timeouts, 5xx errors).
- Add **Data Pipeline Validation** tests.
- Activate **GitHub Actions** for mock \& integration jobs.

**Mid-Term (3–4 weeks):**

- Develop **Performance Tests** (latency, concurrency, memory).
- Extend **Logging Integrity** tests.
- Merge PRD details into `docs/` with central index.
- Begin **DayTradingPlatform** integration trial using test harness.

**Long-Term (5+ weeks):**

- Implement **Scheduled Nightly Runs** and **Alerts** for failures/quota usage.
- Add **AlphaVantage + Additional Providers** with unified adapter interface.
- Build **Backtesting Module** and **UI Dashboard** integration.
- Plan **Production Deployment** with monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana) and Sentry.


## Future Plans, Enhancements \& Improvements

- **Broker Integration:** Alpaca, paper trading.
- **Premium Data Adapters:** TradingView, IEX Cloud replication.
- **AI-Driven Analytics:** Predictive signals, anomaly detection.
- **Multi-Tenant Support:** User profiles, preferences, API key management.
- **UI/UX Dashboards:** React/Vue front-end with real-time charts.


## Special Notes

- **PowerShell Practices:** Always place `param()` first, dynamic version detection, strict error handling.
- **Naming Conventions:**
- Projects: PascalCase with provider suffix (e.g., FinnhubTestHarness)
- Tests: `[Provider][Mode]Tests` (e.g., `FinnhubMockClientTests`)
- Scripts: `run-integration-tests-v{version}.ps1`
- **Logging:** ISO timestamps, structured levels, JSON API archives.
- **Versioning:** Tag `v1.0-integration-ready`, then `v1.1-mock-complete`, `v2.0-alpha-vantage`, etc.

This plan provides a holistic, structured orientation for any AI agent or new team member to understand objectives, status, and next steps.
