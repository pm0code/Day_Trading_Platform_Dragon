To be considered **launch-ready**, a Windows (W) product â€” or any software product â€” typically goes through a structured series of **testing levels** and **phases** that validate its functionality, performance, security, and user experience. Here's a breakdown of the most critical ones:

---

### ðŸ§ª **Testing Levels**

| Level               | Purpose                                                                 |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Unit Testing**     | Verifies individual components or functions work as expected.           |
| **Integration Testing** | Ensures modules interact correctly when combined.                     |
| **System Testing**   | Validates the complete system against requirements.                     |
| **Regression Testing** | Confirms new changes havenâ€™t broken existing functionality.            |
| **Acceptance Testing** | Confirms the product meets business/user expectations.                 |
| **Performance Testing** | Assesses speed, scalability, and responsiveness under load.           |
| **Security Testing** | Identifies vulnerabilities and ensures data protection.                 |
| **Compatibility Testing** | Checks behavior across OS versions, hardware, and configurations.   |
| **Accessibility Testing** | Ensures usability for users with disabilities (e.g., WCAG compliance). |

### ðŸš€ **Phases of Testing Before Launch**

#### âœ… **1. Alpha Phase (Internal Testing)**
- Conducted by developers and QA teams.
- Focuses on core functionality, stability, and early bug detection.
- Includes unit, integration, and system testing.

#### âœ… **2. Beta Phase (External Testing)**
- Released to a limited group of real users.
- Gathers feedback on usability, performance, and edge cases.
- Helps validate real-world compatibility and user satisfaction.

#### âœ… **3. Release Candidate (RC) Phase**
- Final version before launch.
- Only critical bugs are addressed.
- Regression and acceptance testing are emphasized.

#### âœ… **4. Launch Readiness Review**
- Cross-functional sign-off (engineering, QA, product, support).
- Includes documentation, support training, and rollback plans.
- Confirms all testing milestones are met.
