### ðŸ§  Pro Tips
- Always check the **license** (e.g. MIT, GPL, Apache) to confirm it's truly open source.
- Prefer sites that show **download stats**, **user reviews**, and **source code links**.
- If you're on Linux, your distroâ€™s **package manager** (like `apt`, `dnf`, or `pacman`) is also a great place to find vetted FOSS.
