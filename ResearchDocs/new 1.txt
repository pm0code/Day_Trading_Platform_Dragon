  1. BROKEN COMPILATION & RUNTIME

  - Dead code remains: Lines 176-600+ in BacktestingEngineService contain old business logic that should be
  removed
  - Dependency Injection missing: New domain services not registered in DI container
  - Application will crash: Constructor requires services that don't exist in DI

  2. INCOMPLETE PHASE 2 (Days 3-5)

  - ❌ Repository Pattern: Missing IExecutedTradeRepository, IBacktestResultsRepository, etc.
  - ❌ Clean up old code: Hundreds of lines of business logic still in application service
  - ❌ Factory patterns: Missing proper type conversion factories as specified in architecture document

  3. MISSING PHASE 3 (Days 6-10)

  - ❌ Event-driven architecture: Missing TradeExecutedEvent, IDomainEvent pattern
  - ❌ CQRS pattern: Missing ITradeExecutionCommand, ITradeHistoryQuery separation
  - ❌ Proper testing: No tests for new domain services
  - ❌ Monitoring and metrics: Missing observability for new architecture

  4. ARCHITECTURAL INTEGRITY ISSUES

  - Concurrency problems: BacktestingEngine concurrent access not properly handled
  - Shared state issues: Memory cache coordination between services
  - Type mapping: Missing IExecutedTradeMapper as specified in architecture document

  5. PREVENTIVE MEASURES MISSING

  Architecture document specifies:
  - Architecture tests: To prevent boundary violations
  - Type safety patterns: Strong typing to prevent misuse
  - Consistent service patterns: Standardized service operations
