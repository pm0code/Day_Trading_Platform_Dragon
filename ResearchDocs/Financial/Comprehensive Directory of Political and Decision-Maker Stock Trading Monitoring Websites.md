# Comprehensive Directory of Political and Decision-Maker Stock Trading Monitoring Websites

Based on extensive research, I've identified a comprehensive ecosystem of websites and platforms that monitor the stock trading activities of politicians and other decision-making individuals. Here's the complete directory organized by category:

## Political Trading Trackers (Primary Focus)

**Capitol Trades** (https://www.capitoltrades.com) stands out as the industry-leading resource for political investor intelligence[^1][^2]. This platform offers free access to tracking Capitol Hill politicians' trades and is trusted by major media outlets like the Wall Street Journal and New York Times[^1].

**Dub Trading App** copies politician portfolios and trading activities, offering portfolio mirroring and real-time notifications when political figures make trades[^7].

## Official Government Sources

**House Financial Disclosures** (https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/FinancialDisclosure) provides the official US House of Representatives financial disclosure database[^13]. This is the primary source for accessing official disclosures with searchable functionality and legal compliance data.

**Senate Financial Disclosures** (https://www.disclosure.senate.gov) hosts official US Senate financial disclosure and periodic transaction reports[^14][^15]. The platform maintains STOCK Act compliance data and Periodic Transaction Report (PTR) forms.

**OpenSecrets.org** (https://www.opensecrets.org) serves as a comprehensive resource for money in politics transparency, including financial disclosures[^16]. Beyond political trading, it provides campaign finance data, lobbying information, and custom datasets spanning over 30 years.

**Office of Government Ethics** (https://www.oge.gov) manages federal ethics oversight and financial disclosure for the executive branch[^17]. This platform provides executive branch disclosures, ethics guidance, and nominee review processes.

## ETFs and Investment Products

**NANC ETF** (Unusual Whales Subversive Democratic Trading ETF) tracks Democratic congressional trades and has achieved a 58.9% return performance[^18]. **GOP ETF** (Unusual Whales Subversive Republican Trading ETF) tracks Republican congressional trades with a 30.2% return performance[^18]. Both ETFs charge a 0.74% expense ratio and allow investors to mirror congressional trading patterns.

## Corporate Insider Trading Trackers

**InsiderScreener** (https://www.insiderscreener.com) provides professional-grade insider trading tracking across global markets[^19]. The platform monitors Form 4 filings with real-time updates and email alerts covering 10+ international markets.

**SecForm4.com** (https://www.secform4.com) offers SEC Form 4 Edgar filings screening for insider trading[^20]. The platform provides real-time alerts, stock screening capabilities, and institutional holdings analysis.

**HedgeFollow Insider Trading** (https://hedgefollow.com/insider-trading-tracker) monitors recent insider buying and selling activity[^21]. The platform tracks Form 4 transactions with real-time updates and insider watch lists.

**FINVIZ Insider Trading** (https://finviz.com/insidertrading.ashx) provides the latest insider trading transactions and Form 4 filings[^22]. The platform offers real-time quotes, advanced visualizations, and premium features for enhanced analysis.

**HedgeMind** (https://hedgemind.com/13f-filing-dashboard) monitors 13F filings in real-time from institutional investors[^28]. The platform provides real-time monitoring, popular stocks tracking, and comprehensive hedge fund analysis.

## Judicial Branch Tracking

**Fix the Court** (https://fixthecourt.com) advocates for judicial transparency and tracks disclosure compliance[^29]. Since the Courthouse Ethics and Transparency Act, all federal judges' stock trades over \$1,000 must be disclosed within 45 days and posted online.

**Free Law Project** maintains a database of federal judges' financial disclosure reports[^29]. The platform tracks judicial disclosure reports, ethics compliance, and transparency tools for the federal judiciary.

## AI and Advanced Tools

**PoliWatch** represents a revolutionary AI-powered tool developed by UC Berkeley students to catch congressional insider trading[^30]. The platform uses artificial intelligence to analyze congressional stock filings, hearing schedules, committee assignments, and sponsored travel to identify potential conflicts of interest and suspicious trading patterns.

## Key Legal Framework

All these platforms operate under the framework of the **STOCK Act of 2012** (Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act), which requires members of Congress to publicly disclose securities transactions over \$1,000 within 45 days[^31][^15]. The act covers politicians, their spouses, and dependent children, creating the legal foundation for public transparency in political trading.

## Important Considerations

When using these platforms, it's crucial to understand that political trades are disclosed with significant delays (typically 30-45 days), limiting their usefulness for real-time trading decisions[^31][^32]. However, these tools serve essential functions in promoting transparency, identifying potential conflicts of interest, and providing insights into sectors and companies that may be influenced by upcoming legislation or regulatory changes.

The ecosystem of political trading monitoring has evolved significantly, with platforms now offering sophisticated analysis tools, mobile applications, and even investment products that allow ordinary investors to mirror the trading patterns of political figures. This comprehensive directory represents the most complete collection of resources available for monitoring the stock market activities of politicians and other decision-making individuals in government.
