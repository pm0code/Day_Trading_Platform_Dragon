## Conclusion

The Day Trading Platform has a solid foundation with excellent infrastructure, canonical patterns, and core trading features. However, significant gaps exist in AI/ML capabilities, performance optimization, and advanced features specified in the PRD/EDD. The implementation represents approximately 35-40% of the total planned functionality, with critical features like RAPM/SARI algorithms and GPU acceleration completely missing.

Immediate focus should be on completing the data pipeline, implementing core AI/ML features, and achieving performance targets. The existing canonical architecture provides an excellent foundation for rapid feature development once the critical gaps are addressed.
