# Stress-Adjusted Risk Index (SARI) Algorithm

## Mathematical Framework and Implementation Guide

### Overview
The Stress-Adjusted Risk Index (SARI) is an advanced risk management algorithm that dynamically adjusts portfolio risk based on stress testing results and market conditions. Unlike traditional risk measures that rely on historical volatility, SARI incorporates forward-looking stress scenarios to provide a more comprehensive risk assessment.

### Core Concepts

#### 1. Stress Scenario Definition
SARI uses multiple types of stress scenarios:

**Historical Scenarios:**
- 2008 Financial Crisis: Equity -40%, Credit spreads +400bps
- 2020 COVID Crash: Equity -35%, Volatility +300%
- 1987 Black Monday: Equity -20% single day
- 2011 European Debt Crisis: Sovereign spreads +200bps
- 2018 Volmageddon: VIX +115% in one day

**Hypothetical Scenarios:**
- Tech Bubble 2.0: Tech -50%, Other sectors -20%
- China Hard Landing: EM -40%, Commodities -30%
- Interest Rate Shock: +300bps across curve
- Geopolitical Crisis: Oil +50%, Equity -25%
- Cyber Attack: Financials -30%, Tech -40%

**Reverse Stress Testing:**
- What scenario causes 25% portfolio loss?
- What causes liquidity crisis?
- What breaks risk limits?

#### 2. SARI Calculation Formula

```
SARI = Σ(i=1 to N) w_i * S_i * P_i * L_i

Where:
- w_i = Scenario weight (based on probability and severity)
- S_i = Stress loss under scenario i
- P_i = Probability of scenario i
- L_i = Liquidity adjustment factor
- N = Number of scenarios
```

#### 3. Dynamic Weight Calculation

Scenario weights adjust based on:
- Market regime indicators
- Volatility term structure
- Credit spread levels
- Correlation breakdowns
- Liquidity metrics

```
w_i = base_weight_i * regime_multiplier * recency_factor * severity_factor
```

#### 4. Stress Loss Calculation

For each scenario, calculate portfolio loss:

```
StressLoss = Σ(j=1 to M) position_j * shock_j * (1 + interaction_effects)

Where:
- position_j = Current position in asset j
- shock_j = Scenario-specific shock to asset j
- interaction_effects = Non-linear effects and correlations
```

### Implementation Components

#### 1. Scenario Library
Comprehensive database of:
- Historical crisis data with asset-specific shocks
- Hypothetical scenarios based on expert judgment
- Reverse stress test results
- Regime-specific scenarios

#### 2. Propagation Engine
Models how shocks propagate through:
- Asset correlations (normal and stressed)
- Contagion effects
- Liquidity spirals
- Feedback loops

#### 3. Risk Index Calculator
Aggregates scenario results into single metric:
- Weighted average of stress losses
- Tail risk contribution
- Liquidity-adjusted impact
- Time-to-recovery estimates

#### 4. Dynamic Adjustment System
Continuously updates:
- Scenario probabilities based on market signals
- Stress correlations from recent data
- Liquidity parameters from market depth
- Regime indicators from multiple sources

### Advanced Features

#### 1. Multi-Horizon Analysis
SARI calculated for multiple time horizons:
- 1-day: Immediate market shocks
- 1-week: Liquidity and contagion effects
- 1-month: Fundamental repricing
- 3-month: Economic transmission

#### 2. Conditional Scenarios
Scenarios conditioned on current market state:
- If VIX > 30, increase crash probabilities
- If credit spreads widening, increase default scenarios
- If correlations rising, increase systemic scenarios

#### 3. Portfolio-Specific Calibration
SARI adapts to portfolio characteristics:
- Concentration in specific sectors/factors
- Liquidity profile of holdings
- Derivative exposures and non-linearities
- Funding and leverage constraints

### Integration with Portfolio Management

#### 1. Risk Budgeting
```
MaxPosition_i = RiskBudget / (SARI_contribution_i * SafetyFactor)
```

#### 2. Dynamic Hedging
When SARI exceeds thresholds:
- Increase hedge ratios
- Shift to defensive assets
- Reduce leverage
- Improve liquidity profile

#### 3. Scenario-Based Optimization
Optimize portfolio to minimize SARI subject to:
- Return targets
- Tracking error limits
- Transaction costs
- Regulatory constraints

### Calibration and Validation

#### 1. Historical Backtesting
- Test SARI predictions against realized stress events
- Calibrate scenario weights to minimize prediction error
- Validate early warning capabilities

#### 2. Scenario Plausibility
- Expert review of hypothetical scenarios
- Consistency with economic theory
- Cross-validation with other institutions
- Regular updates based on new information

#### 3. Model Risk Management
- Document all assumptions
- Sensitivity analysis of parameters
- Independent model validation
- Comparison with simpler approaches

### Performance Metrics

#### 1. Prediction Accuracy
- Hit rate: Did SARI warn before stress events?
- False positive rate: Unnecessary de-risking
- Magnitude accuracy: Predicted vs. realized losses

#### 2. Portfolio Performance
- Risk-adjusted returns under SARI constraints
- Drawdown reduction vs. unconstrained
- Cost of SARI-based hedging
- Opportunity cost analysis

#### 3. Operational Metrics
- Calculation time (target < 1 minute)
- Scenario update frequency
- System availability (99.9%+)
- Data quality scores
