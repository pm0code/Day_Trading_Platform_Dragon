# Architecture Documentation

## System Overview

This document describes the architecture of the DayTradingPlatform system.

## High-Level Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Frontend Layer"
        UI[User Interface]
        API[API Client]
    end
    
    subgraph "Service Layer"
        SVC[Business Services]
        AUTH[Authentication]
        VAL[Validation]
    end
    
    subgraph "Data Layer"
        DB[(Database)]
        CACHE[(Cache)]
        QUEUE[(Message Queue)]
    end
    
    UI --> API
    API --> SVC
    SVC --> AUTH
    SVC --> VAL
    SVC --> DB
    SVC --> CACHE
    SVC --> QUEUE
```

## Component Structure



## Data Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API
    participant Service
    participant Database
    
    Client->>API: Request
    API->>Service: Process
    Service->>Database: Query
    Database-->>Service: Result
    Service-->>API: Response
    API-->>Client: Data
```

## Deployment Architecture

The system can be deployed in various configurations:

1. **Development**: Single machine setup
2. **Staging**: Distributed services
3. **Production**: High-availability cluster

## Security Architecture

- Authentication: JWT-based
- Authorization: Role-based access control
- Data encryption: At rest and in transit
- API security: Rate limiting and validation
