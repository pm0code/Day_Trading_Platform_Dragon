  - Fixed: Bayesian shrinkage and market regime adjustments
  - Fixed: All fitness calculations and covariance estimators

- **File Fixed**: `TradingPlatform.ML/Ranking/RankingScoreCalculator.cs`
  - Replaced ALL 24 float occurrences with decimal (0 remaining)
  - Fixed: All score calculation methods
  - Fixed: Market regime adjustments and confidence metrics
  - Fixed: Factor completeness and contributions
  - Fixed: ScoreWeights and RankingFilters classes

- **File Fixed**: `TradingPlatform.ML/Features/FeatureEngineering.cs`
  - Replaced ALL 69 float/double occurrences with decimal (0 remaining)
  - Fixed: All technical indicator calculations (RSI, MACD, Bollinger, SMA, EMA)
  - Fixed: All volatility calculations (Realized, Parkinson)
  - Fixed: TechnicalFeatures and MicrostructureFeatures classes
  - Added DecimalMath usage for Sqrt and Log operations

- **File Fixed**: `TradingPlatform.ML/Algorithms/RAPM/RiskMeasures.cs` (Again)
  - Fixed 1 remaining double cast in Math.Floor
  - Now truly 0 float/double remaining

- **File Fixed**: `TradingPlatform.ML/Algorithms/SARI/SARIPortfolioOptimizer.cs`
  - Fixed 1 double cast in Math.Exp â†’ DecimalMath.Exp
  - Now 0 float/double remaining

- **File Fixed**: `TradingPlatform.ML/Interfaces/IMLModel.cs`
  - Fixed 2 Dictionary<string, double> â†’ Dictionary<string, decimal>
  - Interface changes will require implementation updates

- **File Fixed**: `TradingPlatform.ML/Data/MarketDataLoader.cs`
  - Fixed 2 method parameters from double to decimal
  - trainRatio and validationRatio now use decimal

#### 4. Performance Optimizations
- **File Fixed**: `TradingPlatform.FixEngine/Core/OrderManager.cs`
  - Removed LINQ `.Where()` from `GetActiveOrders()` hot path
  - Removed LINQ `.Any()` and `.Sum()` from `CalculateAveragePrice()`
  - Replaced with direct iteration for <100Î¼s latency compliance

### ðŸ“‹ Remaining High Priority Tasks

#### Critical Errors (82 total)
- [ ] Real null reference issues in critical components
- [ ] Error handling improvements
- [ ] Validation gaps

#### Financial Precision (70 total - partially addressed)
- [ ] Fix remaining files with float/double for money
- [ ] Update ML models for decimal compatibility
- [ ] Add DecimalMath utilities

#### Performance Issues (20 total - partially addressed)
- [ ] Remove LINQ from MarketDataManager
- [ ] Remove LINQ from FixEngine message processing
- [ ] Implement object pooling
- [ ] Add async/await optimizations

#### Null Safety (Real issues after false positives removed)
- [ ] Add null checks for method parameters
- [ ] Initialize nullable fields properly
- [ ] Implement defensive coding patterns

### ðŸ”´ Continuous Monitoring

**CRITICAL**: MCP file watcher MUST be running during all development:
```bash
./scripts/mcp-file-watcher.sh
```

### Next Steps

1. Continue fixing financial precision in remaining ML files
2. Find and fix LINQ usage in other hot paths
3. Run fresh MCP analysis to see real issue count
4. Implement null safety patterns for real issues

**Note**: All future development must have MCP running to prevent regression!
